            <h2>The Best Irish Pub</h2>
            <p>
              Dublin, a city of life, hospitality and fun, has a pub culture that
              is famous throughout the world. Dublin is Ireland’s capital and
              Europe’s most treasured city. It is steeped in tradition and
              history.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, San Diego has its very own piece of Dublin, snug in the corner
              of the Gaslamp Quarter’s Fourth Avenue. The Dubliner was
              manufactured by O’Sullivan Interiors and shipped thousands of miles
              across the Atlantic Ocean. It is an authentic Irish pub exuding the
              warm hospitality and fun that is typically Irish.
