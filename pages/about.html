        “May the road rise to meet you.
        May the wind be always at your sails.
        May the sun shine fresh upon your fields.
        And may God hold you in the palm of his hand.”

          <p class="aboutHistory">
            Tynan’s pub was first built in 1702 in Kilkenny Ireland. In 1857 it
            was bought and did up by the Darcy Family, close family relative to
            the present publican James Coady. In 1912 it was bought by the Tynan
            family, the Tynans paid 2000 pounds for the bar at that time. The
            bar would later be bought by the Coady family, James Coady, wife
            Caith and sisters Breda and Mary. On a trip to Ireland, Publican,
            Sam Ladki, enjoyed Tynan’s Pub so much, he decided to build an exact
            replica of Tynan’s in San Diego. In 2001 the two pubs were twinned
            in a ceremony held in Kilkenny, Ireland. In attendance was the Lord
            Mayor of Kilkenny, the Coady family, Alf France – Guinness
            Development Manager, Michael Kough, Billy O’Sullivan of O’Sullivan
            Interiors of Waterford, the Loyal Patrons of Tynan’s Pub and
            Publican, Sam Ladki. In 2002 Twinning ceremonies were also held in
            San Diego at The Dubliner.

          <p class="aboutHistory">On the banks of Ireland’s meandering
            River Suir, in Waterford, is the home of O’Sullivan Interiors,
            Ireland’s most authentic pub design company. Stemming from an area
            steeped in tradition and historical background, where the River Suir
            meets the River Nore and the River Barrow to form one of Ireland’s
            most scenic and treacherous estuaries, fierce Viking raiders created
            a settlement they called “Vatre Fiord”. This area, that resembled
            their own Scandinavian land, remains today and is called the City of
            Waterford. 
          </p>
          <p class="aboutHistory">Another ancient settlement was created in Kilkenny on the
            River Nore, by the Vikings’ descendants, the Normans. These majestic
            invaders built castles and courts that dotted Ireland’s landscape,
            and many of them are still evident today. In the passing of time,
            the Normans adopted Irish customs, intermarried with local Celts,
            and, it is said that they became as Irish as the Irish themselves.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutHistory">
            With ancient Celtic games and the great Irish pastime of story
            telling, fun and music, the Celtic tradition flourished. Ireland
            became famous for it’s pub culture over the years, especially with
            the introduction of a certain Irish porter called Guinness.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutHistory">The
            Dubliner’s shop front is typical of the original fronts on Dublin’s
            famous Grafton Street, where you can sit in the blissful
            surroundings watching the world go by. Time stands still in the
            Irish heritage pubs. The Horse Shoe Bar in The Dubliner is a replica
            of Kilkenny’s 19th Century Tynan’s Bridge House Bar. It is made from
            solid Irish oak, and every detail has been painstakingly reproduced,
            down to the moldings, panels, and hand carvings. The quality of
            O’Sullivan Interiors’ Irish craftsmen is evident. The bar creates
            its own truly unique identity and is a fitting tribute of
            originality and of the character of Ireland’s heritage pubs.
          </p>
          <p class="aboutHistory"> The
            Victorian Lounge is a replica of the old Shelbourne Lounge in Dublin
            City, with it’s original cast iron fireplace, and Dublin City bench
            seats and period chairs, all of which compliment the stained glass
            snug screens. The interior completely recreates the feeling of an
            old Irish Victorian bar.
